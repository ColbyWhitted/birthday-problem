# birthday-problem
This is a practical example of how the birthday problem works.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem

In this script guests are added to a guest list. These guests have birthdays. Everytime a new guest is added to the guest list we check to see if the latest guest has the same birthday as someone else already in the guest list. When we find a match, we indicate it.
